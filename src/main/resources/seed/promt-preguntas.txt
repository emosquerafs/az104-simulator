You are an AZ-104 question author. Create ORIGINAL questions aligned to Microsoft Learn/Azure Docs skills measured. Do NOT use dumps. Do NOT copy real exam items.

DELIVERABLE (must follow)
- Your response must be the **exact contents of a single JSON file** (no markdown, no explanations, no code fences, no extra text).
- The JSON must be directly saveable as: **az104_{DOMAIN}_{N}_bilingual.json** (I will copy/paste and save it, or download it if the tool supports file attachments).
- Therefore: the first character of your output must be `[` and the last character must be `]`.

GOAL
Generate N={N} questions for DOMAIN={DOMAIN} (one of: IDENTITY_GOVERNANCE, STORAGE, COMPUTE, NETWORKING, MONITOR_MAINTAIN).
Language: bilingual EN+ES for stem/options/explanation (UTF-8; keep accents and punctuation).
Style: certification-like scenarios, realistic constraints, plausible distractors, short technical explanations.

HARD QUALITY RULES (must pass)
1) No duplicates:
   - No repeated stem meaning. Keep an internal set of fingerprints:
     fingerprint = normalize(stem.en) + '|' + sorted(correct option texts in EN).
2) Domain coherence:
   - Every option must be relevant to the same subtopic as the stem.
   - Never mix unrelated services (e.g., DNS answers in a pure storage-account question) unless the scenario explicitly depends on that (e.g., private endpoint + private DNS zone).
3) Anti-guessing:
   - SINGLE/YESNO: correct label distribution across A–D must be roughly balanced (no label > 35%).
   - MULTI: correct choices must NOT be always the first two. Vary 2–3 correct options and spread labels across A–F.
   - Before final output, run a sanity test mentally:
     - If a student always picks A (SINGLE) and the first two options (MULTI), expected score must be <= 35%.
4) Difficulty:
   - EASY: 1 concept, minimal constraints.
   - MEDIUM: 2 constraints + one decision tradeoff.
   - HARD: multi-step reasoning OR cross-feature nuance (limits/behavior) OR troubleshooting scenario.
5) Explanations:
   - Provide a short technical rationale why correct is correct and why the top distractor is wrong (EN+ES). No fluff.

DISTRIBUTION TARGETS
- Difficulty: ~25% EASY, ~55% MEDIUM, ~20% HARD
- Types: ~55% SINGLE, ~30% MULTI (2–3 correct), ~15% YESNO
- Options:
  - SINGLE: exactly 4 options (A–D), exactly 1 correct
  - YESNO: 2 options (A=Yes, B=No) OR 4 options (A–D), but exactly 1 correct
  - MULTI: 5–6 options (A–F), exactly 2 or 3 correct

TAGS
Use 3–5 tags per question, lowercase with hyphens, tied to subtopics.
Examples for STORAGE: storage-account, replication-lrs-zrs-grs, access-tiers, lifecycle-management, sas, storage-firewall, private-endpoint, service-endpoint, azure-files, blob-versioning

OUTPUT FORMAT (strict JSON)
Return an array of objects with EXACT field names and structure:
[
  {
    "domain": "{DOMAIN}",
    "difficulty": "EASY|MEDIUM|HARD",
    "qtype": "SINGLE|MULTI|YESNO",
    "stem": { "en": "...", "es": "..." },
    "explanation": { "en": "...", "es": "..." },
    "options": [
      { "label": "A", "text": { "en": "...", "es": "..." }, "isCorrect": true }
    ],
    "tags": ["tag-one","tag-two","tag-three"]
  }
]

Generate now N={N} for DOMAIN={DOMAIN}. Ensure uniqueness and anti-guessing rules are satisfied.
